## Module: <code>ekera</code>
A module for factoring N completely given the order r of an element g selected uniformly at random from the multiplicative group of the ring of integers modulo N, where g need not be explicitly specified. This by using the algorithm from [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1).

This module furthermore contains convenience functions for first solving the frequency j yielded by the quantum part of Shor's order-finding algorithm [[Shor94]](https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1994.365700) for a positive integer multiple r' of r, and for then solving r' for the complete factorization of N. This by using the classical post-processing algorithms from [[E24]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3655026) in the first step, and the algorithm from [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1) in the second step.

Finally, this module contains convenience functions for first solving a list of n frequencies [j_1, ..., j_n] yielded by n runs of the quantum part of Seifert's variation [[Seifert01]](https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45353-9_24) of Shor's order-finding algorithm [[Shor94]](https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1994.365700) for a positive integer multiple r' of r, and for then solving r' for the complete factorization of N. This by using the classical post-processing algorithms from [[E24t]](https://diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1902626/FULLTEXT01.pdf) (see Sect.Â 5.4) and [[E21]](https://doi.org/10.1515/jmc-2020-0006), with supporting functions from [[E24]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3655026), in the first step, and by using the algorithm from [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1) in the second step.

Throughout this module, the algorithms are as described in [[E24t]](https://diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1902626/FULLTEXT01.pdf), [[E24]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3655026), [[E21]](https://doi.org/10.1515/jmc-2020-0006) and [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1). The notation is also inherited from said works.
