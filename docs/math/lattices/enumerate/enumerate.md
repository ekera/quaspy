## Function: <code>enumerate(B, R2, ..)</code>
Enumerates all vectors in the lattice L generated by the rows of the basis B that are within distance R of the vector t.

The n x d integer basis matrix B is represented as as list of lists [b_1, ..., b_n], for b_i = [b_i1, ..., b_id] for i = 1, ..., n the n row vectors that make up B where b_ij is of type int or mpz.

This function currently requires B to be square and to have full row rank since it calls solve_left(B, t) which takes the inverse of B to solve. These requirement may be relaxed in the future.

## Import directive
```python
from quaspy.math.lattices.enumerate import enumerate
```

## Parent module
- [<code>enumerate</code>](README.md)

## Prototype
```python
def enumerate(B : list,
              R2 : int | gmpy2.mpz | gmpy2.mpq | gmpy2.mpfr,
              t : list[int | gmpy2.mpz | gmpy2.mpq | float | gmpy2.mpfr] | None = None,
              timeout : int | None | quaspy.utils.timeout.Timeout = None,
              gs : list[list[list[int | gmpy2.mpz | gmpy2.mpq | gmpy2.mpfr]]] | None = None,
              precision : int | None = None)
```

## Parameters
| <b>Name</b> | <b>Description</b> |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| B | The n x d basis matrix B = [b_1, ..., b_n], where b_i = [b_i1, ..., b_id] for i = 1, ..., n represent the n row vectors that make up the basis. |
| R2 | The square of the enumeration radius R. |
| t | The vector t = [t_1, ..., t_d] in span(L). May be set to None, in which case t = [0, ..., 0]. |
| timeout | A timeout in seconds after which a TimeoutError will be raised and the enumeration aborted. The timeout is represented as integer or as an instance of Timeout. May be set to None, as is the default, in which case no timeout is enforced.<br><br>Note this function incrementally yields the vectors that are found during the enumeration. The timeout specified here is respect to the time elapsed since enumerate() was first called. It hence includes any time spent processing the results yielded by this function until control returns to this function. |
| gs | The list [Bs, M], where Bs is the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalized basis for B, and M is the associated matrix of Gram–Schmidt projection factors, as returned by calling<br><br>[Bs, M] = gram_schmidt(B, precision = precision),<br><br>or None, in which case this function will make the above call.<br><br>If you plan to perform several enumerations in the same lattice, then time may be saved by not re-computing Bs and M for each call.<br><br>Note that the basis B is typically LLL-reduced by calling lll() before calling this function. The lll() function can return not only B but also Bs and M (since Bs and M are incrementally computed as a part of the LLL reduction process) allowing you to directly pass them along to this function. |
| precision | The precision to use when computing the Gram–Schmidt projection factors in M. May be set to None, in which case the projection factors are represented as exact quotients.<br><br>Note that this parameter only has an effect if gs is set to None as the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalized basis Bs and the associated matrix M of Gram–Schmidt projection factors are otherwise pre-computed.<br><br>return A list [x_1, ..., x_m] of the m vectors found, where each vector x_i = [x_i1, ..., x_id] for 1, ..., m. This function yields one vector at a time allowing you to enumerate over the vectors. |
