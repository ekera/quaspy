## Function: <code>babai(B, t, ..)</code>
Uses Babai's nearest plane algorithm [[Babai86]](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02579403) to find a vector x that is in the lattice L, and that is close to a target vector t, where L is generated by the rows of a reduced basis matrix B.

More specifically, it holds that | t - x | <= 2^(n/2) dist(t, L) if B is delta-LLL-reduced with delta >= 3/4.

The basis matrix B is represented as as list of lists [b_1, ..., b_n], where b_i = [b_i1, ..., b_id] for i = 1, ..., n represent the n row vectors that make up the basis.

## Import directive
```python
from quaspy.math.lattices.babai import babai
```

## Parent module
- [<code>babai</code>](README.md)

## Prototype
```python
def babai(B : list,
          t : list,
          Bs : list[list[int | gmpy2.mpz | gmpy2.mpq | gmpy2.mpfr]] | None = None,
          precision : int | None = None)
```

## Parameters
| <b>Name</b> | <b>Description</b> |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| B | The n x d basis basis matrix B = [b_1, ..., b_n], where b_i = [b_i1, ..., b_id] for i = 1, ..., n represent the n row vectors that make up the basis. |
| t | The target vector t = [t_1, ..., t_d]. |
| Bs | The Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization Bs of B, if available, or None in which case the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization B is computed by this function. (If you plan on calling this function several times for the same lattice L, then you may wish to pre-compute Bs and pass it along in each call to this function. Note also that the function lll() for computing delta-LLL-reduced bases B optionally computes Bs alongside B.) |
| precision | The precision to use when computing the Gram–Schmidt projection factors in M. May be set to None, in which case projection factors are represented as exact quotients.<br><br>Note that this parameter only has an effect if gs is set to None as the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalized basis Bs and the associated matrix M of Gram–Schmidt projection factors are otherwise pre-computed. |

## Return value
A vector x that is in the lattice L generated by B, and that is close to t. More specifically, | t - x | <= 2^(n/2) dist(t, L) if B is delta-LLL-reduced with delta >= 3/4.
