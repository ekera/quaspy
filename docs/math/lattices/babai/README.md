## Module: <code>babai</code>
A module for Babai's nearest plane algorithm.

## Import directive
```python
import quaspy.math.lattices.babai
```

## Parent module
- [<code>lattices</code>](../README.md)

## Functions
- [<code>babai(B, t, ..)</code>](babai.md)

  Uses Babai's nearest plane algorithm [[Babai86]](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02579403) to find a vector x that is in the lattice L, and that is close to a target vector t, where L is generated by the rows of a reduced basis matrix B.
