## Module: <code>sampling</code>
A module for sampling a frequency pair (j, k) heuristically from the distribution induced by Shor's quantum algorithm for finding a given discrete logarithm d in a group of known order r, or from the distribution induced by Ekerå–Håstad's and Ekerå's quantum algorithms, depending on how parameters are selected.
