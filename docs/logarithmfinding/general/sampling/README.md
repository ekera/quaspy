## Module: <code>sampling</code>
A module for sampling a frequency pair (j, k) heuristically from the distribution induced by the quantum part of Shor's algorithm for finding a discrete logarithm d in a group of known order r, or from the distribution induced by the quantum part of Ekerå's variation thereof, depending on how parameters are selected.
