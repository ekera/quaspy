## Submodules
- [<code>postprocessing</code>](postprocessing/README.md)

  A module for solving a frequency pair (j, k) yielded by the quantum part of Shor's algorithm for the general discrete logarithm problem for the logarithm d given the order r.

- [<code>sampling</code>](sampling/README.md)

  A module for sampling a frequency pair (j, k) heuristically from the distribution induced by Shor's quantum algorithm for finding a given discrete logarithm d in a group of known order r, or from the distribution induced by Eker√•'s quantum algorithm, depending on how parameters are selected.
