  """ @brief  Tests the solve_j_for_r() function for a given r, and a given
              set of parameters and optimization flags.

      This function first calls sample_j_given_r(r, m, l, B = B_sample) to
      sample a Fourier frequency j from the distribution induced by the quantum
      order-finding algorithm, for r as passed to this function.

      Unless a larger value of m is explicitly specified, m is set to the bit
      length of the order r. If some Delta in [0, m) is specified, l = m-Delta,
      otherwise l is set to the least positive integer such that r^2 < 2^(m+l).

      @remark   If the sampling fails, this function returns silently, as it is
                expected that sampling j may sometimes fail.

      This function then calls

      to attempt to solve j for r, or for some positive multiple of r, depending
      on how the acccept_multiple flag is selected. Above, g is a simulated
      cyclic group element of order r (see the SimulatedCyclicGroupElement
      class), and B = B_solve. All other parameters are simply passed along.

      For the full documentation of these parameters, see solve_j_for_r().

      @param r  The order r.

      @param m  A positive integer m such that r < 2^m, or None, in which case
                this function will set m to the bit length of r.

      @param Delta  An integer in [0, m) used to select l = m-Delta, or None,
                    in which case this function will set l to the least positive
                    integer such that r^2 < 2^(m+l).

      @param c  A parameter c >= 1 that specifies the maximum size of the
                missing cm-smooth component d in r = d * r_tilde when solving j
                for r.

      @param B_solve  A bound B >= 0 on the offset in j when solving j for r.

                      If B > 0, this function tries to solve not only j, but
                      also j ± 1, .., j ± B, for r, or for a positive integer
                      multiple of r. For further details, see solve_j_for_r().

      @param B_sample   A bound B >= 0 on the offset in j when sampling j. For
                        further details, see sample_j_given_r().


      @param accept_multiple  A flag that may be set to True to indicate that
                              only a positive integer multiple of r is sought.
                              If set to True, this function returns as soon as
                              it finds r such that g^r = 1.

      @param method   An enumeration entry from the SolutionMethods class that
                      specifies the method to use to solve j for r. For further
                      details, see the documentation for the SolutionMethods
                      class.

      @param verbose  A flag that may be set to True to print intermediary
                      results and status updates when executing the test.

      @param opt_speculative  A flag that may be set to True to indicate that
                              Algorithm 2 in [E22p] should be used instead of
                              Algorithm 3 to find the missing cm-smooth
                              component of r. In most cases, Algorithm 2 is
                              faster than Algorithm 3, but in the worst case
                              Algorithm 2 is a lot slower than Algorithm 3. For
                              further details, see [E22p].

      @param opt_isolate_peak   A flag that may be set to True to indicate that
                                all offsets in j up to B should not be tested
                                exhaustively. Rather, the peak around the
                                optimal frequency j_0(z) should be isolated: As
                                soon as offsets to the left and right of j_0(z)
                                are found for which the post-processing
                                algorithm fails to produce r such that g^r = 1,
                                this function returns the minimum r found such
                                that g^r = 1. Note that this flag has no effect
                                if the accept_multiple flag is set to True, as
                                this function then returns as soon as it finds r
                                such that g^r = 1.

      @return   This function has no return value. If the test fails, or if some
                other error occurs, an exception is instead raised.

                The test succeeds if the solve_j_for_r() function behaves as
                expected, i.e. if it succeeds in all cases where it is
                guaranteed to succeed by the analysis in [E22p], and either
                succeeds or fails otherwise.

                If the solve_j_for_r() function fails in a case where it is
                guaranteed to succeed in theory, an exception is raised. """
