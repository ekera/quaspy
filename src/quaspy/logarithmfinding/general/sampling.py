      @param d  The discrete logarithm d in [1, r).

      @param r  The order r.

      @param m  A positive integer m such that r < 2^m when sampling from the
                distribution induced by Shor's algorithm or Eker책's algorithm,
                and such that d < 2^m when sampling from the distribution
                induced by Eker책-H책stad's algorithm.

      @param sigma  An non-negative integer sigma such that m + sigma is the
                    length of the first control register in the quantum
                    algorithm. It is required that r < 2^(m + sigma).

      @param l  A positive integer l such that l is the length of the second
                control register in the quantum algorithm.

      @param B_DELTA  A parameter that upper-bounds the offset from the optimal
                      frequency k0(j) when sampling k given j and eta.

      @param B_ETA  A parameter that upper-bounds eta when sampling j and eta.

      @param verbose  A flag that may be set to True to print intermediary
                      results when sampling.

      @param extended_result  A flag that may be set to True to not only return
                              the frequency pair [j, k], but
                              [[j, k], [k0(j), offset, eta]].

      @return   The frequency pair [j, k] sampled if the extended_result flag is
                set to False, or [[j, k], [k0(j), offset, eta]] if the
                extended_result flag is set to True, or None if sampling failed
                because the upper bound on the offset from the optimal frequency
                k0(j) or on eta were reached. """
