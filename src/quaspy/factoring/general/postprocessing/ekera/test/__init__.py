      @remark   This convenience function simply iterates over all combinations
                of l in [256, 512, 1024], n in [2, 5, 10, 25], and e_max in
                [1, 2, 3], calling both test_solve_r_for_factors_of_random_N
                and test_solve_j_for_factors_of_random_N() for each combination.

      @param verbose  A flag that may be set to True to print intermediary
                      results. Defaults to True.

      @return   This function has no return value. If the test fails, or if some
                other error occurs, an exception is instead raised. """
