  """ @brief  An enumeration of optimization options for how the solver is
              to select x, and to process composite factors.

      There are three optimization options:

      1. JOINTLY_MOD_N

         Select x uniformly at random from Z_N^*, for N the number to be
         factored, and exponentiate x modulo N to 2^t o.

         This is as described in the algorithm in Sect. 3.2 of [E21b].

      2. JOINTLY_MOD_Np

         Select x uniformly at random from Z_N'^*, for N' the product of all
         pairwise coprime composite factors of N currently stored in the
         collection, and exponentiate x modulo N' to 2^t o.

         This is as above, but with optimizations from Sect. 3.2.1 of [E21b].

      3. SEPARATELY_MOD_Np

         Select x uniformly at random from Z_N'^*, for N' the product of all
         pairwise coprime composite factors of N currently stored in the
         collection. Exponentiate x modulo N' to 2^t o, as N' runs over the
         pairwise coprime composite factors of N currently stored in the
         collection.

         This is as above, with more optimizations from Sect. 3.2.1 of [E21b].

      Note that all three options are equivalent with respect to their ability
      to find non-trivial factors of N. The options differ only in terms of
      their arithmetic complexity. Although several exponentiations may be
      required when the default option is used, this fact is, in general, more
      than compensated for by the fact that the moduli are smaller, leading the
      default option to outperform the other two options.

      @param r   The order r of g, or a positive integer multiple of r.

      @param N   The integer N.

      @param c   A parameter c >= 1 that specifies the maximum size of the
                 missing cm-smooth component in lambda'(N) when solving r for
                 the complete factorization of N. In this context, m is the bit
                 length of N, and cm-smoothness is defined as in [E21b, E22p].

                 As is explained in [E21b], increasing c increases the success
                 probability, at the expense of increasing the runtime.

      @param k   The maximum number of iterations to perform. Defaults to None.
                 If k is set to None, as many iterations as are necessary to
                 completely factor N will be performed. If k is explicitly
                 specified, and the complete factorization of N has not been
                 found after k iterations, an exception of type
                 IncompleteFactorizationException will be raised.

      @param timeout  A timeout in seconds. Defaults to None. If the timeout is
                      set to None, as much time as is necessary to completely
                      factor N will be used. If a timeout is explicitly
                      specified, and the complete factorization of N has not
                      been found when the timeout elapses, an exception of type
                      IncompleteFactorizationException will be raised.

      @param verbose  A flag that may be set to True to print intermediary
                      results. Defaults to False.


      All other parameters control various optimizations. They are documented
      below, and in the code. It is recommended to use the defaults.


      @param opt_split_factors_with_multiplicity  A flag that may either be set
                                                  to True (default option) or to
                                                  False.

        When set to True, as is the default, the solver initially tests if
        gcd(r, N) yields a non-trivial factor of N. If so, the non-trivial
        factor is reported.

        When set to False, the aforementioned test is not performed.

        To understand the test, note that if p^e divides N, for e > 1 an integer
        and p a large prime, then p^(e-1) is likely to also divide r. Note
        furthermore that it is relatively inexpensive to split N by computing
        gcd(r, N), compared to exponentiating modulo N.

        For random N void of small factors, it is very unlikely for prime
        factors to occur with multiplicity. For such N, this optimization is
        hence not of any practical use. It is only if N is likely to have
        factors that occur with multiplicity, for some special reason, that
        this optimization is useful in practice. This optimization may also
        yield non-trivial factors if N has small factors. However, such factors
        would typically first be removed, e.g. by trial division, before calling
        upon these more elaborate factoring techniques.

        Note that for N as in the problem instances setup in Appendix A.3 of
        [E21b], prime factors are intentionally forced to occur with
        multiplicity with high probability (when e_max > 1). This so as to test
        that such special cases are handled correctly by the solver. For such N,
        this optimization is likely to report non-trivial factors. This served
        as our rationale for including it as an option.

        This optimization is described in earlier works in the literature, see
        for instance [GLMS15] for one such description.

        [GLMS15] Grosshans, F., T. Lawson, F. Morain and B. Smith: "Factoring
                 Safe Semiprimes with a Single Quantum Query".
                 ArXiv 1511.04385 (2015).


      @param opt_report_accidental_factors  A flag that may either be set to
                                            True (default option) or to False.

        When set to True, as is the default, the solver reports non-trivial
        factors of N found "by accident" when sampling x (denoted x_j in [E21b])
        uniformly at random from Z_{N'}^*, for N' equal to N, or to the product
        of all pairwise coprime composite factors of N in the factor collection,
        depending on which option is selected for opt_process_composite_factors.
        When set to False, such non-trivial factors are not reported.

        Note that it is very unlikely for non-trivial factors to be found by
        accident if N is void of small prime factors. It is only if small
        factors of N are not first removed, e.g. by trial division, that factors
        are likely to be found by accident. On the other hand, if we do find
        factors by accident, it is only logical to report them. This served as
        our rationale for including this optimization as an option.

        Note furthermore that if N has small factors when this optimization is
        enabled, and if opt_process_composite_factors is furthermore set to
        OptProcessCompositeFactors.JOINTLY_MOD_N, then the same non-trivial
        factor of N may be repeatedly found by accident when sampling. This may
        generate long printouts.

        Also note that factors that are found "by accident" when sampling g
        uniformly at random from Z_N^* are not reported even if
        opt_report_accidental_factors is set to True. This is because such
        factors, if found in practice, would typically affect for which N order
        finding is performed in the first place.


      @param opt_abort_early  A flag that may either be set to True (default
                              option) or to False.

        When set to True, as is the default, the solver computes x^(2^i o) for
        0, 1, .., min(s, t), for t as in [E21b] and s the least non-negative
        integer such that x^(2^s o) = 1. When set to False, the solver instead
        computes x^(2^i o) for i = 0, 1, .., t.

        Note that when opt_square (see below) is set to True, the solver first
        computes x^o. It then takes consecutive squares to form x^(2^i o) for
        each i. It follows that the saving incurred by this optimization is
        fairly minor when the opt_square flag is set to True, as it is trivial
        to square one. It is only if the opt_square flag is set to False that
        the saving is substantial.


      @param opt_square   A flag that may either be set to True (default option)
                          or to False.

        When set to True, as is the default, the solver first computes x^o. It
        then takes consecutive squares to form x^(2^i o) for each i. When set to
        False, the solver na챦vely computes x^(2^i o) from scratch for each i.

        This optimization is described in Sect. 3.2.1 of [E21b].


      @param opt_exclude_one  A flag that may be set either to True (default
                              option) or to False.

        When set to False, the solver selects g and x (denoted x_j in [E21b])
        uniformly at random from Z_N^* and Z_{N'}^*, respectively, for N' equal
        to N, or to the product of all pairwise coprime composite factors of N
        in the factor collection, depending on which option is selected for the
        opt_process_composite_factors flag.

        When set to True, as is the default, the solver excludes one by instead
        selecting g and x uniformly at random from Z_N^* \ {1} and
        Z_{N'}^* \ {1}, respectively.

        This optimization is described in Sect. 3.2.1 of [E21b].


      @param opt_process_composite_factors  An enumeration entry from the
                                            OptProcessCompositeFactors class
                                            that specifies how x should be
                                            selected, and composite factors
                                            processed, by the solver.

        As is described in OptProcessCompositeFactors, there are three options:

        1. OptProcessCompositeFactors.JOINTLY_MOD_N

          The solver selects x (denoted x_j in [E21b]) uniformly at random from
          Z_N^*. It then exponentiates x modulo N. This is how the unoptimized
          algorithm is described in Sect. 3.2 of [E21b].

        2. OptProcessCompositeFactors.JOINTLY_MOD_Np

          The solver selects x uniformly at random from Z_{N'}^*. It then
          exponentiates x modulo N'.

          Above N' is the product of all pairwise coprime composite factors of N
          currently stored in the factor collection.

        3. OptProcessCompositeFactors.SEPARATELY_MOD_Np (default option)

          The solver selects x uniformly at random from Z_{N'}^*, for N' the
          product of all pairwise coprime composite factors of N currently
          stored in the factor collection.

          The solver then exponentiates x modulo N' where N' now runs over all
          pairwise coprime composite factors of N currently stored in the factor
          collection. This is the default option.

        Note that all three options are equivalent with respect to their ability
        to find non-trivial factors of N. The options differ only in terms of
        their arithmetic complexity. Although several exponentiations may be
        required when the default option is used, this fact is, in general, more
        than compensated for by the fact that the moduli are smaller, leading
        the default option to outperform the other two options.

        This optimization is described in Sect. 3.2.1 of [E21b].

              This by using the algorithm in [E21b] to factor N given r, or a

      @remark   This convenience function simply calls solve_j_for_r(), and then
                solve_r_for_factors(), passing along r. To access all options of
                these functions, call them manually in sequence instead.

      @param j  The frequency j yielded by the quantum order-finding algorithm.

      @param m  A positive integer m such that r < 2^m.

      @param l  A positive integer l <= m, such that m+l is the length of the
                control register in the quantum order-finding algorithm.

                If method is set to SolutionMethods.CONTINUED_FRACTIONS_BASED or
                SolutionMethods.LATTICE_BASED_SHORTEST_VECTOR, it is required
                that r^2 < 2^(m+l) or else r may not be found.

                If method is set to SolutionMethods.LATTICE_BASED_ENUMERATE, it
                is possible to select l = m - Delta for some Delta in [0, m), at
                the expense of enumerating at most 6 * sqrt(3) * 2^Delta lattice
                vectors for each offset in j considered.

      @param g  The group element g of order r.

      @param N  The integer N.

      @param c_solve  A parameter c_solve >= 1 that specifies the maximum size
                      of the missing smooth component d in r = d * r_tilde when
                      solving j for r, or a multiple of r. As is explained in
                      [E22p], increasing c increases the success probability, at
                      the expense of increasing the runtime.

      @param c_factor   A parameter c_factor >= 1 that specifies the maximum
                        size of the missing smooth component in lambda'(N) when
                        solving r for the complete factorization of N. As is
                        explained in [E21b], increasing c increases the success
                        probability, at the expense of increasing the runtime.


      @param B  A bound B >= 0 on the offset in j. If B > 0, the solve_j_for_r()
                function called by this function tries to solve not only j, but
                also j 짹 1, .., j 짹 B, for r, or for a positive integer multiple
                of r.

      @param k  The maximum number of iterations to perform when factoring N
                given the order r, or a multiple of r. Defaults to None.

                If k is set to None, as many iterations as are necessary to
                completely factor N will be performed. If k is explicitly
                specified, and the complete factorization of N has not been
                found after k iterations, an exception of type
                IncompleteFactorizationException will be raised.

      @param timeout  A timeout in seconds. Defaults to None. If the timeout is
                      set to None, as much time as is necessary to completely
                      factor N given the order r, or a multiple of r, will be
                      used. If a timeout is explicitly specified, and the
                      complete factorization of N has not been found when the
                      timeout elapses, an exception of type
                      IncompleteFactorizationException will be raised.

      @param accept_multiple  A flag that may be set to True to indicate that
                              only a positive integer multiple of r is sought.
                              If set to True, the solve_j_for_r() function
                              called by this function returns as soon as it
                              finds r such that g^r = 1.

      @param method   An enumeration entry from the SolutionMethods class that
                      specifies the method to use to solve j for r. For further
                      details, see the documentation for the SolutionMethods
                      class.

      @param verbose  A flag that may be set to True to print intermediary
                      results and status updates when executing the
                      post-processing algorithm.

      @param opt_speculative  A flag that may be set to True to indicate that
                              Algorithm 2 in [E22p] should be used instead of
                              Algorithm 3 to find the missing cm-smooth
                              component of r. In most cases, Algorithm 2 is
                              faster than Algorithm 3, but in the worst case
                              Algorithm 2 is a lot slower than Algorithm 3. For
                              further details, see [E22p].
