  """ @brief  Sets up x = g^d' for d' = (N - 1) / 2 - 2^(l - 1) given g and N,
              for N the product of two large random distinct l-bit primes.

      This is a convenience function for Ekerå–Håstad's algorithm [EH17] that
      factors a large random RSA integer N = pq into p and q.

      More specifically, as is explained in App. A.2 of [E20], it holds that

        x = g^d' = g^((N - 1) / 2 - 2^(l - 1))
                 = g^((p - 1) / 2 + (q - 1) / 2 - 2^(l - 1)) = g^d.

      Provided that the order r of g is sufficiently large, it holds that

        d = d' mod r = (p - 1) / 2 + (q - 1) / 2 - 2^(l - 1),

      allowing d to be computed as the discrete logarithm of x to the base g.

      This may be done efficiently by using Ekerå–Håstad's quantum algorithm
      that computes short discrete logarithms in groups of unknown order.

      Given d = (p - 1) / 2 + (q - 1) / 2 - 2^(l - 1) and N = pq, it is then
      trivial to compute p and q by solving a quadratic equation.

      This convenience function computes x in the above procedure given g and N.
