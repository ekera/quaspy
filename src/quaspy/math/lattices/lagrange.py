  """ @brief  Returns the Lagrange-reduced basis for a 2 x 2 basis matrix A.

      The basis matrix A is represented as as list [u, v], where u = [u_1, u_2]
      and v = [v_1, v_2] represent the two row vectors that make up the basis.

      @param A  The 2 x 2 basis basis matrix A = [u, v], where u = [u_1, u_2]
                and v = [v_1, v_2] represent the two row vectors of the basis.

      @param multiples  Row multiples of the form [[m_uu, m_uv], [m_vu, m_vv]]
                        such that [m_uu * u + m_uv * v, m_vu * u + m_vv * v] is
                        a close to Lagrange-reduced basis for A, or None as is
                        the default if no such side information is available.

                        If row multiples are provided, they are used to start
                        the reduction process with a close to reduced basis,
                        typically speeding up the reduction process.

                        The matrix representing the row multiple must have full
                        rank if row multiples are provided. For as long as this
                        basic requirement is met, a Lagrange-reduced basis for A
                        will be returned even if the row multiples are way off.

      @return   The pair [A', multiples'], where A' = [u', v'] is a
                Lagrange-reduced basis for A = [u, v], and multiples' is of the
