This directory contains [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks that exemplify the use of the [Quaspy](https://github.com/ekera/quaspy) library.

## Order finding [<img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ekera/quaspy/blob/main/examples/orderfinding.ipynb)
For examples that illustrate how to use the [Quaspy](https://github.com/ekera/quaspy) library to simulate quantum order finding, and to solve the frequency returned by the quantum part of the order-finding algorithm for the order, please see the [<code>orderfinding.ipynb</code>](orderfinding.ipynb) notebook.

The examples in this notebook are based on the modified version of Shor's algorithm for the order-finding problem described in [[E22p]](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2201.07791), and on the post-processing described in [[E22p]](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2201.07791).
